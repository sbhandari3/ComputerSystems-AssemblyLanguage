Lab1:
In this lab we used a schematic entry logic simulation program, otherwise known as MMLogic. We created truth tables and implemented logic based on those truth tables. For part A, I connected the wires from the user input switches to the 7 segment display component. For part B, we were supposed to read and truth table and create a circuit which outputs the three bits shown from the for inputs given on the truth table. I did so by using a XOR gate as well as grounding one output. For part C, we had to use SOP or POS in order to implement the truth table given. We also had to then implement SOP or POS using only NAND gates and the only NOR gates. I used SOP, not POS and was able to find a pattern in which the truth table became simple and I was able to show it using a few inverters, AND gates, and an OR gate.

The file in the directory is called Lab1.lgi.

To test my work for the lab I would turn on the switches. With turning different switches on for each combination I would see whether the light from each bit would turn on. To know if I had the correct output the lights per bits per part would light up based on when the truth table output was a 1.
